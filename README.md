## How to run Istanbul
Istanbul writes a report which lets you know which functions/branches are being called. See more here: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-istanbul. To generate a report for the file you want, copy the following into your terminal:
```bash
node ./node_modules/.bin/istanbul cover test.js
```
