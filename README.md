# autocompletr

Everyone's favourite team, "rm -rf uk", is ready to get cracking on their new project, autocompletr.

### This uses a trie graph to return autocomplete words, which are then randomly chosen from and sorted into shorter array to be rendered (for now they are simply console.loged).  

The big issue that autocompletr and autocompletr2 should be merged together, but they are not.
