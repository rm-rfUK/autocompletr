# autocompletr

Everyone's favourite team, "rm -rf uk", is ready to get cracking on their new project, autocompletr.

On Wednesday morning the group split into three teams to investigate three parts of the back-end for their webapp.

* Jakub - writing the get request
* Kara - setting up the server
* Rory - the search algorithm
